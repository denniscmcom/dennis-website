Welcome.

I’m a programmer based in Spain with interests in 3D graphics, hardware design, and finance. I occasionally write blog posts about whatever catches my interest [here](/blog/index.html), and I also create [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@denniscmcom) videos.

Outside of my main interests, I enjoy many other things. I’m into boxing, photography, and waiting at airports drinking coffee. I also just got a MIDI keyboard and have been messing around with making music. I suck at all of them with no particular order.
