Welcome!    

I’m a programmer based in Spain with interests in systems programming, hardware design, and networking. I occasionally write blog posts about whatever catches my interest [here](/blog/index.md), and I also create [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@denniscm6) videos.   

If you like what I do, I am available to work.
